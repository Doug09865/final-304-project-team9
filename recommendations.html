      <h2>Future Recommendations: Technological Improvements</h2>
      <p><em>Technological improvements are a part of our future recommendations for using ChatGPT in a less harmful way. The people that are helping to further develop ChatGPT should continue refining the AI models to minimize biases by training the data outputs to be fair across all demographics and different social groups. Improved moderation techniques can also ensure that AI tools don’t spread harmful content or misinformation. Implementing robust consent filtering systems and ethical training guidelines could lessen this spread of misinformation. ChatGPT should also be prioritizing privacy preserving techniques like differential privacy (mathematically rigorous framework for releasing statistical information about datasets while protecting the privacy of individual data subjects, Wikipedia) to provide personalized experiences for everyone without compromising their data.</em></p>

      <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
      <p><em>Policy-level recommendations are also a part of our recommendations for using ChatGPT in the near future. We think that governments and organizations should enforce regulations that mandate ethical AI development that includes things like accountability, transparent principles, and fairness. Current models that are in place like the EUs AI Act can serve as things that we can work towards to enforce these notions. We should also encourage cooperation on an international scale to establish consistent global standards for AI use in sectors like healthcare, education, and governance. Lastly, there should also be external audits of AI systems to ensure compliance with the ethical standards put in place in the future and to meet the public’s interests towards AI systems.</em></p>
      <h3>Social Strategies</h3>
      <p><em>We think that social strategies are also important in the future of ChatGPT and AI as a whole. We believe that educating the public about AI’s capabilities and limitations can reduce misinformation and misuse. It should be easily accessible knowledge that all people should have before using AI systems. Users should understand how to critically evaluate the outputs that ChatGPT and other AI’s give them and recognize the potential inaccuracies or biases that different AI’s could have which included ChatGPT since that is the most popular AI model used today. We also think that collaborations should be involved in the future of AI, like collaboration between developers, users, and ethics to identify/ address the concerns that AI produces could help ensure that AI technology evolves to meet societal values properly. ChatGPT and other AI’s should also have tools they use to actively combat disinformation and promote media literacy. Like fact checking systems for example to complement public knowledge initiatives.</em></p>
